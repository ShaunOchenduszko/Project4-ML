# Notes
- The Final Data with Colors set was used for the machine learning in this project.
- The Color Extraction and top 1000 data set were the results of an effort to utlize and group the colors in a different way to improve performance.
- Our intial datasets were not uploaded due to size constraints, however, the ETL notebook includes the code to conduct the necessary API pulls.
