The Final Data set was used for the machine learning in this project.

The top 1000 was an effort to try to utlize and group the colors in a different way, testing to see if it preformed better.

Note: Our intial datasets were not uploaded due to size constraints, however, the ETL notebook includes the code to conduct the necessary API pulls.
